### LameGram

Lame #VanillaJs project with #MVC and #SPA. Just a blog for the 10 infamous lame people. I Will be updating whenever I feel like it.

## Live Demo: https://aimuhire.github.io/lamegram/ 

#### Architecture: MVC

This project illustrates the Model View Controller architecture used by most popular frontend Frameworks using VanillaJs, pure and plain.

#### SPA with Routing that works(hmmm...)

This project is also a Single Page Application for it only loads the index.html once, all the subsequent pages are injected into the DOM using JavaScript.


I might keep on improving this project as it might help some JS users interested in MVC and SPA to learn some of the fundamental best practices.

Of course it's far from perfect, so feel free to raise an issue or make some contributions.



# ðŸ˜’ LameGram: so lame!
The name of the project was picked from a handful of lame abstract project names. It was solely picked because it met the one requirement of being the lamest.

#### ooh... The NodeJs Express server
Ignore the file. It was used initially for development just to respond or 404 with the index.html page.
This Github depployment is now using @rafgraph SPA on Github Pages fix.
